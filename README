This directory (Three_Body_Stillinger_Weber__MD_000000111111_000) contains Stillinger-Weber potential
Model Driver written in C.

1. This is a direct extention of the standard Stillinger-Weber potential to supports multiple species.
   A subset of the supported species can be used. For example, if there are 3 species A, B and C in the
   parameter file, the use of single species A (or B or C) or two species A and B (or A and C, or B and C)
   are valid.
   
2. The functional form has been rewritten so as to separate the parameters. Compared to the standard 
   Stillinger-Weber potential, the following redefinition has been done:
   A := A*epsilon
   lambda := lambda*epsion
   gamma  := gamma*sigma
   rcut   := a*sigma
  
The cutoff of standard Stillinger-Weber potential is given implicitly by cutoff = `a*sigma', where `a' is 
a potential parameter.  In this Model Driver, we do not use `a', but give the cutoff explicitly.  By doing 
this, if `sigma' is updated through `PARAM_FREE_sigma' then there is no needed to update `cutoff'.



3. One parameter file is needed, and the parameters should be given as:
     first line: number of species

   Then each line lists the following 9 parameters for interaction between two species:
     A(in ev) B p q lambda(in eV) gamma(in Angstorm) sigma(in Angstrom) costheta_0 cutoff

   Note one should list all the interactions for one species and then proceed to list all the
   interaction for the next species.  For example, if there are 3 species, then the parameters should be  
   in the following order,
     (1,1)
     (1,2)   # (2,1) is the same as (1,2), so only list it once here
     (1,3)
     (2,2)
     (2,3)
     (3,3)
     where, (i,j) means the parameters for species i and species j.  There should be N*(N+1)/2 such lines for 
     N species. 


The Model Driver complies with the KIM API standard, using four neihgbor handling methods: MI_OPBC_F,
NEIGH_PURE_F, NEIGH_RVEC_F, and CLUSTER and iterator or locator mode. It publishes its parameters
and supports optional computation of `energy', 'forces', 'particleEnergy', 'process_dEdr',
and 'process_dE2dr2'. Its initializaton routine takes a KIM API object pointer and a pointer to a string 
that contains all parameters which define a KIM Model based on this KIM Model Driver.
