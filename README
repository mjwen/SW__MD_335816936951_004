This directory (Three_Body_Stillinger_Weber__MD_000000111111_000) contains Stillinger-Weber potential
Model Driver written in C.


It can support one species or two species.  For one species, the implementation is exactly the 
Stillinger-Weber potential as described in Phys. Rev. B, vol. 31, 5262-5271, 1985.  For two species,
three-body interactions can only happen between certain atom groups, and also additional cutoffs are 
needed.  Let's consider the three-body interaction between aotms i, j, and k. Three body interactions 
theta_ijk ,where i is the center atoms, is considered only when species_i = Spec1, species_j = Spec2,
and species_k = Spec2 or species_i = Spec2, species_j = Spec1, and species_k = Spec1. And addition
cutoff for r_jk is also needed.  


One parameter file is needed, and the parameters should be given as:

For one species:

  first parameter: number of species (i.e. 1)

Then the parameters in the listed order:
  A
  B
  p
  q
  lambda
  gamma
  sigma (in Angstrom)
  epsilon (in ev)
  costheta_0
  cutoff


For two species:

  first parameter: number of species (i.e. 2)

Then the parameters for interactons in the listed order:

species1-species1 (two-body interaction)
species1-species2-species2 (or species2-species1-species1; they are the same; three-body interaciton)
species2-species2 (two-body interaction)

For each interactions, the parameters are listed in the following order:
  A
  B
  p
  q
  lambda
  gamma
  sigma (in Angstrom)
  epsilon (in ev)
  costheta_0
  cutoff

For two body interacitons, lambda, gamma and costheta_0 will not be used.  So they could be any value.

As discussed above, three-body interactions only exist for atoms groups of species1-species2-species2, 
where species1 is the center atom and species2-species1-species1 where species2 is the center atom.
So only one set of three-body interaction parameters is needed (without considering the additional cutoffs).

Then two additional cutoffs are listed: 
cutoff_jk for species1-species2-species2 interaction 
cutoff_jk for species2-species1-species1 interaction 


The cutoff of standard Stillinger-Weber potential is given implicitly by cutoff = `a*sigma', where `a' is 
a potential parameter.  In this Model Driver, we do not use `a', but give the cutoff explicitly.  By doing 
this, if `sigma' is updated through `PARAM_FREE_sigma' then there is no needed to update `cutoff'.


The Model Driver complies with the KIM API standard, using four neihgbor handling methods: MI_OPBC_F,
NEIGH_PURE_F, NEIGH_RVEC_F, and CLUSTER and iterator or locator mode. It publishes its parameters
and supports optional computation of `energy', 'forces', 'particleEnergy', 'process_dEdr',
and 'process_dE2dr2'. Its initializaton routine takes a KIM API object pointer and a pointer to a string 
that contains all parameters which define a KIM Model based on this KIM Model Driver.
